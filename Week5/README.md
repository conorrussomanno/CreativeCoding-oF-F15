#Week 5 - "Forrest"

###Topics

* Project 1 Wrap-up

###Agenda

* 15 minutes of presentation prep.
* In-class presentations of your trees (8 min per presentation)!
	* All are encouraged, none are required.
	* Explain what you did... what's new/different about your sketch?
	* What were your biggest challenges/hurdles?
	* What were your biggest successes?
* Walkthrough on creating a README and using Mou...
* Making a forrest... if we have time...
	* Maybe just white board and pseudocode	 	

### Helpful Resources

* For creating a README, use the markdown editor [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) 
	* Any directory or sub-directory in Github can have it's own README. All you have to do is save a .md (markdown) file called REAMDE.md in the directory.
	* for more information on using Mou, check out [the following Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yin1FFkr5p0).
* For creating a screencapture of you interacting with your application you can use QuickTime Player
	* To do this, open QuickTime Player, then click **File > New Screen Recording**

### HW due next Thursday (10/1/15) @ 6pm

* Make sure you've pushed your Project 1 into a unique directory in your Github repo. The directory should be called "Project1" and it should be in your primary repo with all of your homework folders from weeks 1-4, as follows:
	* Creative_Coding_oF_firstName_lastName/
		* Week1/
		* Week2/
		* Week3/
		* Week4/
		* Project1/
* Your Project 1 should have a README with at least one screenshot of your tree. Feel free to also include a screencapture of you interacting with your Tree App and recursively generating different trees.
* If you haven't put a brief bio and a picture of yourself in your primary repo's README, please do so now!
* Next week is animation!!!
